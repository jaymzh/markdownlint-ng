# Markdownlint-ng

Markdownlint-ng was forked from Markdown to allow the project to continue
when development was halted for several months. In order to prevent a similar
fate, this project has added several maintainers.

We aim to make sure the project has longevity, and to that end we want to make
adding new maintainers a simple process.

If you would like to be a maintainer, you need to demonstrate some ongoing
contributions - either reviews of PRs or PR contributions. They need not be large.
Then send a PR to add yourself to this list. The existing maintainers will
have a discussion, and assuming there are no objections, you'll be added.
